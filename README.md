# SumOfIntervalsCodeWars
Code the help calculate the span of given intervals.

This code made me realize that Programming is more than just coding.
The coding and the coding languages are only tools used to sovle problems.
Where theses problems can range for mild things such as calculating the number of working days in a year to 
complex things such as complex math problems or high level abstractions of real world objects.
